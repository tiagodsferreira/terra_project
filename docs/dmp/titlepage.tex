\noindent
\textbf{Summary.} This Data Management Plan outlines the procedures for the collection, processing, documentation, storage, protection, sharing, and long-term preservation of data generated within the \#TERRA. project. The project produces quantitative survey and longitudinal data on adolescents’ pro-environmental attitudes and behaviors, complemented by contextual information from parents and school heads. All data management procedures comply with FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) and applicable data protection regulations. Personal data are stored separately from research datasets and protected through encryption and restricted access protocols. Processed and fully anonymized datasets will be deposited in a public repository with a persistent identifier (DOI) and licensed under CC BY-SA 4.0 to ensure transparency, reproducibility, and responsible data reuse.
